<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Linear Smoke Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reflective</li><li>End to End</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The linear smoke detector market is primarily divided into two types: reflective and end-to-end systems. Reflective detectors use a light source and a receiver positioned on the same side of a sensing area, detecting smoke through light obstruction. In contrast, end-to-end detectors consist of a transmitter and a receiver placed on opposite ends, assessing smoke presence based on the interruption of a light beam. Both types offer effective smoke detection, yet they cater to different spatial and installation requirements.</p></p>
