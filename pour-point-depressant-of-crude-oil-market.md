<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pour Point Depressant of Crude Oil Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Surface Active Agents Type Based</li><li>Polymer Type Based</li><li>Compound Copolymer Type Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pour point depressants (PPDs) in the crude oil market are categorized into three main types based on their composition and functioning. Surface active agents enhance fluidity by altering the surface tension, reducing the formation of wax crystals. Polymer-based PPDs work by modifying the structure of wax crystals, making them easier to flow. Compound copolymers combine features of both categories to provide superior performance, effectively lowering the pour point and improving the overall handling of crude oil under low-temperature conditions.</p></p>
