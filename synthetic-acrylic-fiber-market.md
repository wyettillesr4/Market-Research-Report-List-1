<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Synthetic Acrylic Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Spinning</li><li>Dry Spinning</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The synthetic acrylic fiber market primarily employs two spinning methods: wet spinning and dry spinning. </p><p>Wet spinning involves dissolving the fiber-forming material in a solvent, which is then extruded into a coagulating bath to form filaments. This method is suitable for producing high-performance fibers with excellent properties.</p><p>Dry spinning, on the other hand, entails dissolving the material in a solvent that evaporates upon extrusion into hot air, forming the fibers. This technique is generally faster and more economical, making it widely used in commercial applications.</p></p>
