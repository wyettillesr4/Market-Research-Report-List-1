<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Adult ICU Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Adult ICU ventilator market is categorized into two primary types: invasive and non-invasive ventilators. Invasive ventilators involve the use of endotracheal tubes or tracheostomy to deliver mechanical breath support directly into the airways, providing precise control for critically ill patients. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, provide respiratory support through masks or nasal interfaces, allowing for easier patient comfort and reduced complications. Both types are vital for managing respiratory failure and supporting patient recovery in intensive care settings.</p></p>
