<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Centrifugal Draught Fans Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial</li><li>Backward</li><li>Forward</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Centrifugal draught fans are categorized into three main types based on blade design and airflow characteristics. Radial fans feature blades that extend radially from the hub, providing a high pressure but lower airflow capacity, ideal for applications requiring strong pressure. Backward-curved fans have blades that curve away from the direction of rotation, offering improved efficiency and lower noise levels, suitable for general ventilation. Forward-curved fans, with blades curved in the direction of rotation, produce high airflow at lower pressures, commonly used in compact systems.</p></p>
