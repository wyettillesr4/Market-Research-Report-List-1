<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanized Irrigation Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Center Pivot</li><li>Lateral Move</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mechanized irrigation systems enhance agricultural efficiency by automating water distribution. The center pivot system consists of a rotating horizontal arm mounted on wheeled towers, allowing uniform irrigation of circular crop areas. In contrast, lateral move irrigation systems feature a long, straight structure that travels side to side across the field, ensuring even coverage over rectangular plots. Both systems optimize water usage, reduce labor costs, and improve crop yields, making them vital for modern agricultural practices.</p></p>
