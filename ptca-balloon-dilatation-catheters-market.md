<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PTCA Balloon Dilatation Catheters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi Compliant</li><li>Non Compliant</li><li>Compliant</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PTCA balloon dilatation catheters are categorized into semi-compliant, non-compliant, and compliant types based on their behavior during inflation. Semi-compliant balloons expand moderately at lower pressures while maintaining some shape stability, making them useful for lesions requiring gentle dilation. Non-compliant balloons maintain their shape and don't significantly expand past a certain pressure, ideal for severe blockages. Compliant balloons expand significantly with increased pressure, allowing for controlled dilation in various lesion types, providing flexibility in treatment options.</p></p>
